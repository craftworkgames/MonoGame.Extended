## How to install

See the [How to install MonoGame.Extended](https://github.com/craftworkgames/MonoGame.Extended/wiki/How-to-install-MonoGame.Extended) wiki page. 

The package comes with 2 DLLs:

 - MonoGame.Extended.dll
 - MonoGame.Extended.Content.Pipeline.dll
 
The `MonoGame.Extended.Content.Pipeline.dll` is intended to be used with the [Pipeline tool](http://www.monogame.net/documentation/?page=Pipeline). 
To reference the DLL in the Pipeline tool please edit your `Content.mgcb` file and add a reference to it.

**Remember**: the versions need to match exactly for everything to work.
