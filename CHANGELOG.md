### Added
- Added unit test for `PolyGon.Contains` to ensure consistency in expected return values for edge touching compared to MonoGame. [@AristurtleDev](https://github.com/AristurtleDev) [#871](https://github.com/craftworkgames/MonoGame.Extended/pull/871)
- Added unit test for `BitmapFont.MeasureString` to validate that it correctly accounts for trailing whitespace. [@AristurtleDev](https://github.com/AristurtleDev) [#876](https://github.com/craftworkgames/MonoGame.Extended/pull/876)
- Added unit test for `ContentReaderExtensions.GetRelativeAssetName` to validate that asset name sanitization resolves to correct path. [@AristurtleDev](https://github.com/AristurtleDev) [#877](https://github.com/craftworkgames/MonoGame.Extended/pull/877)
