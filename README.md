MonoGame.Extended is an open source extension library for [MonoGame](http://www.monogame.net/). A collection of classes and extensions to make it easier to make games with MonoGame. 

## Patreon Supporters

Thanks to all those that support the project on Patreon!  Running an open source project can be done on a shoe string budget, but it's certainly not free. A little funding goes a long way. It keeps the build server up and running and let's me devote more of my time to the project. Even just a few supporters really helps.

**What happens to MonoGame.Extended if we don't get the funding?** Never fear. The project won't die. The code will always be safely open sourced on github.

## We're working towards the v0.6 release

There's a lot going on in the `develop` branch right now. We're working towards the next official release (v0.6.xxx). If you want to keep up with the latest and greatest it's recommended that you:

 - [Install a pre-release NuGet package](https://github.com/craftworkgames/MonoGame.Extended/wiki/How-to-use-the-pre-release-NuGet-packages) or;
 - [Build from source](https://github.com/craftworkgames/MonoGame.Extended/wiki/Building-MonoGame.Extended-from-source)

## Version 0.5 is available on NuGet

MonoGame.Extended v0.5 was published on 8th April 2016 as [a NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/MonoGame.Extended/). Please read the [install guide](https://github.com/craftworkgames/MonoGame.Extended/wiki/How-to-install-MonoGame.Extended) to setup the Pipeline tool.

    Install-Package MonoGame.Extended

This release is compatible with MonoGame 3.5!

**Note**: If you're still using MonoGame 3.4 you must upgrade to 3.5 for everything to work.

## Forums
Our forum is part of the [MonoGame community](http://community.monogame.net/category/extended). Please ask any questions or post about problems or bugs that you have found there. Let us know if you're making a game with MonoGame.Extended!

## Development status
MonoGame.Extended has a growing community of contributors adding to the project all the time. We also have [Nuget packages](https://www.nuget.org/packages/MonoGame.Extended/) of published releases and of course you can [build from source](https://github.com/craftworkgames/MonoGame.Extended/wiki/Building-MonoGame.Extended-from-source) to get the latest and greatest.

Please keep in mind that the project is still evolving. Some breaking API changes are likely to occur as we progress.

## Usage
MonoGame.Extended is a portable class library that sits on top of MonoGame. It's designed to work on all supported platforms using a single portable DLL. At runtime, the portable library will call into the platform specific MonoGame DLL referenced in your project. If you do use it on another platform please [let us know](http://community.monogame.net/category/extended)!

## Documentation
We've got several feature demos in this repository and we're building up [the wiki](https://github.com/craftworkgames/MonoGame.Extended/wiki). You can also pop into [the forums](http://community.monogame.net/c/extended), check out [my blog](http://dylanwilson.net/), ask a question on [gamedev stack overflow](http://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/monogame-extended) or use our [live chat](https://gitter.im/craftworkgames/MonoGame.Extended).

## How to install

See the [How to install MonoGame.Extended](https://github.com/craftworkgames/MonoGame.Extended/wiki/How-to-install-MonoGame.Extended) guide. Here's the TL;DR version:

The library is distributed as a NuGet package. Add a reference to your project using the following command:

	Install-Package MonoGame.Extended

The package comes with 2 DLLs:

 - MonoGame.Extended.dll
 - MonoGame.Extended.Content.Pipeline.dll
 
The `MonoGame.Extended.Content.Pipeline.dll` needs to be referenced by the [Pipeline tool](http://www.monogame.net/documentation/?page=Pipeline). To reference the DLL in the Pipeline tool you'll  need to edit your `Content.mgcb` file.
