## Patreon Supporters

Thanks to all those that support the project on Patreon!  Running an open source project can be done on a shoe string budget, but it's certainly not free. A little funding goes a long way. It keeps the build server up and running and let's me devote more of my time to the project. Even just a few supporters really helps.

**What happens to MonoGame.Extended if we don't get the funding?** Never fear. The project won't die. The code will always be safely open sourced on github.

If you're using the [NuGet packages](https://www.nuget.org/packages?q=monogame.extended) please read the [install guide](http://craftworkgames.github.io/MonoGame.Extended/installation/) to setup the Pipeline tool.

Alternately, you might want to [build from source](https://github.com/craftworkgames/MonoGame.Extended/wiki/Building-MonoGame.Extended-from-source) or use a [pre-release NuGet package](https://github.com/craftworkgames/MonoGame.Extended/wiki/How-to-use-the-pre-release-NuGet-packages).

Please keep in mind that the project is still evolving. Some breaking API changes are likely to occur as we progress.
