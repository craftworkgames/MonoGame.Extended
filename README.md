## Patreon Supporters

Thanks to all those that support the project on Patreon!  Running an open source project can be done on a shoe string budget, but it's certainly not free. A little funding goes a long way. It keeps the build server up and running and let's me devote more of my time to the project. Even just a few supporters really helps.

**What happens to MonoGame.Extended if we don't get the funding?** Never fear. The project won't die. The code will always be safely open sourced on github.
