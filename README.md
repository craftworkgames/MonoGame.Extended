# MonoGame.Extended

MonoGame.Extended is an extension to the [MonoGame](http://www.monogame.net/) framework that makes it easier to make games. It's a collection of packages designed to let you choose what you want without getting in your way.

It makes MonoGame more awesome.

[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/dylanwilson/MonoGame.Extended/_apis/build/status/craftworkgames.MonoGame.Extended?branchName=develop)](https://dev.azure.com/dylanwilson/MonoGame.Extended/_build/latest?definitionId=1&branchName=develop) [![Docs](https://img.shields.io/badge/docs-latest-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)](http://docs.monogameextended.net/)

## Getting started

The libraries are distributed as NuGet packages and can be installed into your existing MonoGame project using your favorite NuGet Package Manager in Visual Studio, Xamarin Studio, or MonoDevelop. 

For example:

    Install-Package MonoGame.Extended

Once you've installed one or more of the main packages you might also want to install the Content Pipeline extensions.

To do this you'll need to manually reference the `MonoGame.Extended.Content.Pipeline.dll` in the [MonoGame Content Pipeline Tool](http://docs.monogameextended.net/Installation/#referencing-the-content-pipeline-extension) because it doesn't support NuGet directly.

Alternately, if you want to try the latest and greatest you might want to [build from source](http://docs.monogameextended.net/Development/Building-from-Source/).

## News

We're in the process of developing MonoGame.Extended 3.6! 

There may be some confusion, pain and disruption for a while. Here's what you need to know:
 
 - Everything that used to be in the `develop` branch is now in `master`
 - NuGet packages built from `master` have been [published to nuget.org as version 1.1](https://www.nuget.org/packages?q=monogame.extended)
 - There's lots of breaking changes happening to create a cleaner more useful API
 - From now on we're going to (attempt) to use [Git Flow](https://gitversion.readthedocs.io/en/latest/git-branching-strategies/gitflow/)
 - We're now using [cake builds](https://cakebuild.net/) so that you can build everything (including the NuGet packages) locally
 - We're migrating everything to [.NET Standard!](https://www.patreon.com/posts/one-library-to-18916187)

## Design goals

 - The primary goal is to make it easier to *make games*.
 - Choose the features you like and the rest stays out of your way.
 - A clean and consistent API familiar to MonoGame developers.
 - It's *not* a game engine, but extends the framework.
 - Follow [C# coding guidelines](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms229002(v=vs.110).aspx).
