/// <summary>
/// A modifier that rapidly decreases particle opacity based on their age.

/// <remarks>
/// The <see cref="OpacityFastFadeModifier"/> creates a linear fade-out effect where particles
/// become more transparent as they age.
///
/// Important notes:
/// <list type="bullet">
///   <item>
///     <see cref="Particle.Age"/> is normalized to the emitter's configured lifespan, so the fade
///     completes exactly at end of life regardless of the particle's actual lifespan in seconds.
///   </item>
///   <item>
///     Unlike other modifiers that accumulate changes over time, this modifier directly sets
///     the opacity value each frame based on the particle's age and initial opacity.
///   </item>
/// </list>
