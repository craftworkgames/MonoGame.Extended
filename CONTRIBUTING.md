We're happy that you have chosen to contribute to the MonoGame Extended project.

You are joining a team of dedicated volunteers that are building an extension library to the game framework [MonoGame](http://www.monogame.net/).

Please read this document completely before contributing.


## How To Contribute

MonoGame.Extended has a `master` branch for stable releases and a `develop` branch for daily development.  New features and fixes are always submitted to the `develop` branch.

If you are looking for ways to help you should start by looking at the [Open Issues](https://github.com/craftworkgames/MonoGame.Extended/issues).  Please let us know if you plan to work on an issue so that others are not duplicating work.

The MonoGame.Extended project follows standard [GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html).  You should learn and be familiar with how to [use Git](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/), how to [create a fork of MonoGame.Extended](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/), and how to [submit a Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).

After you submit a PR the MonoGame.Extended [build server](http://build.craftworkgames.com/) will build your changes and verify all tests pass. Project maintainers and contributors will review your changes and provide constructive feedback to improve your submission.

Once satisfied that your changes are good for MonoGame.Extended we will merge it.


## Quick Guidelines

Here are a few simple rules and suggestions to remember when contributing to MonoGame.Extended.

* :bangbang: **NEVER** commit code that you didn't personally write.
* :bangbang: **NEVER** use decompiler tools to steal code and submit them as your own work.
* :bangbang: **NEVER** decompile XNA assemblies and steal Microsoft's copyrighted code.
* **PLEASE** try keep your PRs focused on a single topic and of a reasonable size or we may ask you to break it up.
* **PLEASE** be sure to write simple and descriptive commit messages.
* **DO NOT** surprise us with new APIs or big new features. Open an issue to discuss your ideas first.
* **DO NOT** reorder type members as it makes it difficult to compare code changes in a PR.
* **DO** give priority to the existing style of the file you're changing.
* **DO** try to add to our [unit tests](Source/MonoGame.Extended.Tests) when adding new features or fixing bugs.
* **DO NOT** send PRs for code style changes or make code changes just for the sake of style.
* **PLEASE** keep a civil and respectful tone when discussing and reviewing contributions.
* **PLEASE** tell others about MonoGame.Extended and your contributions via social media.


## Decompiler Tools

We prohibit tools like dotPeek, ILSpy, JustDecompiler, or .NET Reflector which convert compiled assemblies into readable code.

It is **NEVER ACCEPTABLE** to decompile copyrighted assemblies and submit that code to the MonoGame.Extended project.

* It **DOES NOT** matter how much you change the code.
* It **DOES NOT** matter what country you live in or what your local laws say.  
* It **DOES NOT** matter that XNA is discontinued.  
* It **DOES NOT** matter how small the bit of code you have stolen is.  
* It **DOES NOT** matter what your opinion is of stealing code.

If you did not write the code, you do not have ownership of the code, and you shouldn't submit it to MonoGame.Extended.

If we find a contribution in violation of copyright it will be immediately removed.  We will bar that contributor from the MonoGame.Extended project.
