# Welcome

Welcome to the documentation for [MonoGame.Extended](https://github.com/craftworkgames/MonoGame.Extended), a collection of NuGet packages that make [MonoGame](http://www.monogame.net/) more awesome.

We're only just getting started building this documentation. If you're not finding what you're looking for we've got a number of other places to get help.

 - We've got a live chatroom on [gitter](https://gitter.im/craftworkgames/MonoGame.Extended)
 - We've got our own section on the [MonoGame Community Forums](http://community.monogame.net/c/extended)
 - Development is usually discussed in [github issues](https://github.com/craftworkgames/MonoGame.Extended/issues)
 - We've even got a [tag on stackoverflow](http://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/monogame-extended) ;)

 *Initially the plan is to port over the relevant pages from the wiki. Over time, this should become the place to be for those with the need to read.*

# Getting Started

 - [Installation](installation.md)

# Packages

## Core
The `MonoGame.Extended` core library contains common classes and interfaces the other MonoGame.Extended libraries reference.

By itself, it creates a solid foundation with sprites, [bitmap fonts](MonoGame.Extended/BitmapFonts.md), collections, serialization, shapes, texture atlases, viewport adapters, cameras, timers, math and diagnostics.

## Animations
The `MonoGame.Extended.Animations` library contains classes useful for 2D sprite sheet animations.

## Collisions
The `MonoGame.Extended.Collisions` library contains a 2D grid based collision system.

## Content.Pipeline
The `MonoGame.Extended.Content.Pipeline` library extends the [MonoGame Content Pipeline tool](http://www.monogame.net/documentation/?page=Pipeline). This adds Animations, BitmapFonts, TextureAtlases, and Tiled maps to the Content Pipeline tool.

## Entities
The `MonoGame.Extended.Entities` library adds an [Entity Component System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity%E2%80%93component%E2%80%93system) (ECS) to MonoGame.

## Graphics
The `MonoGame.Extended.Graphics` library contains extensions useful for generating dynamic geometry and batching draw calls.

## Gui
The `MonoGame.Extended.Gui` library contains a complete GUI system.  It includes Buttons, Text Boxes, Dialogs and many other controls, and is skinnable.

## Input
The `MonoGame.Extended.Input` library contains input listener classes that have events you can use to subscribe to input events, instead of having to poll for input changes.

## NuclexGui
The `MonoGame.Extended.NuclexGui` library contains an implementation of the [Nuclex GUI Framework](https://nuclexframework.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Nuclex.UserInterface) for XNA, ported to MonoGame.

## Particles
The `MonoGame.Extended.Particles` library contains a high performance Particle System ported from the [Mercury Particle Engine](matthew-davey.github.io/mercury-particle-engine/).

## SceneGraphs
The `MonoGame.Extended.SceneGraphs` library contains a scene graph (tree) system.


## Tiled
The `MonoGame.Extended.Tiled` library loads and renders maps created with the popular [Tiled Map Editor](http://www.mapeditor.org/).

## Tweening
The `MonoGame.Extended.Tweening` library contains class extensions for tween based animations.
